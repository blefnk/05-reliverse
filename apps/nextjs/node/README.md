# Next.js 13: Node.js App Router

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

The project tries to be as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join the [Reliverse Discord](https://discord.gg/Pb8uKbwpsJ) or [T3 Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

To create [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers) add an `api/` directory to the `app/` directory with a `route.ts` file. For individual endpoints, create a subfolder in the `api` directory, like `api/hello/route.ts` would map to [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello).
