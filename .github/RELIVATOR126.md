[**ðŸ‘‰ Read the Detailed Blog Post About 1.2.6 Update ðŸ‘ˆ**](https://reliverse.org/relivator/v126)

Relivator 1.2.6 was released on August 4, 2024! We are now actively working on the next major update, Relivator 1.3.0, with the goal of making the project production-ready, clean, and high-quality. We invite you to join us in actively searching for issues, contributing freely, and earning cool rewards. A canary branch was launched a few days ago (and is available to everyone in the main repo), and the dev branch is also now available (the dev branch is available for a limited time to all sponsors at any paid pledge level).

**ðŸ”¥ Important Note:** Relivator currently requires specifying Clerk environment variable keys, as its API has changed. We are working on making Clerk optional again. However, all other environment variables are optional. If this statement is incorrect and something is broken, please let us know.
