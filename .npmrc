# Expo doesn't play nice with pnpm by default. 
# The symbolic links of pnpm break the rules of Expo monorepos.
# @see https://docs.expo.dev/guides/monorepos/#common-issues
# node-linker=hoisted

# Prevent pnpm from adding the "workspace:"" prefix to local
# packages as it causes issues with manypkg
# @see https://pnpm.io/npmrc#prefer-workspace-packages
# save-workspace-protocol=false
# prefer-workspace-packages=true

# May help with some pnpm/bun issues
