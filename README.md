# Reliverse CLI

*Build the Sites. Build the Apps. Build the Games. Build Anything.*

**Reliverse** is a CLI tool designed to streamline the setup of JavaScript, TypeScript, and other types of projects, with a primary focus on Next.js templates, though it is not limited to them. It allows you to effortlessly bootstrap projects, including the [Relivator Next.js template](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator-nextjs-template) or any other template from GitHub or other Git-based sources. Additionally, Reliverse assists in managing configuration files and resolving potential conflicts between tools like ESLint, Prettier, and Biome.

## TL;DR

**It's a single tool for everything.** At its current stage, Reliverse CLI is a powerful CLI website builder, means project bootstrapper, right in your terminal. But it's not going to be just a website builder in the future. And even already you can start from scratch or with a template, setting everything up automatically or customizing it to your exact preferences. With all the tools pre-configured and ready to go, you can build exactly what you envision.

Remember the feeling of empowerment when you first used a website builder like WordPress? It gave you the freedom to create. But eventually, you hit limitsâ€”PageSpeed Insights flagged issues, the performance lagged, and the bloated size of your site became hard to ignore.

*Thatâ€™s where Reliverse comes in.* Reliverse is designed to fix the problems of traditional website builders, offering a universal toolset that lets you create anything you can imagineâ€”efficiently and with ease.

## Get Started

Reliverse is still in its early stages, but it already allows you to bootstrap websites quickly. Soon, advanced customization options will be available, along with game-building tools and other exciting features. You're going to love what's coming.

By the way, you might imagine that a CLI doing so many things would become bloated, like an elephant in the room, but donâ€™t worryâ€”itâ€™s going to be lean. This is the dream of a creator, a dream that must become reality. Everything has to be perfect.

*Psst... Weâ€™re already working on a frontend version of the builder too!* ðŸ˜‰

## Installation

You should install [Git](https://git-scm.com), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), and [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) first, then use:

- [bun](https://bun.sh) i -g reliverse
- or: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack) add -g reliverse
- or: [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) global add reliverse
- or: [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager) i -g reliverse

## Usage

Once installed, you can use **Reliverse CLI** to create new projects or manage existing ones. Navigate to the root of your desired directory and run:

```bash
reliverse
```

## Features

- **Create Projects**: Build new projects from scratch, including your own version of **Relivator Next.js template**, or install any other templates from GitHub.
- **Support for JavaScript/TypeScript Projects**: Primarily designed for React and Next.js projects, but works with other JavaScript/TypeScript libraries as well.
- **Automatic Configuration Management**: Handles project configuration, including ESLint, Biome, Putout, GitHub, and IDE settings.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Detects existing configurations and helps resolve file conflicts, giving you control over which files to keep or replace.
- **Interactive Prompts**: Customize your setup through interactive prompts that allow you to select which file categories to include.
- **Template-Driven**: Automatically clones and installs templates from GitHub to kickstart your development.
- **Unlimited possibilities**: It can work not only with templates! Are you going to clone a JS library? Feel free to use Reliverse!
- **Anything else?!**: Currently, the CLI is optimized for JS/TS projects (like React, Astro, Vue, Svelte, etc.). But in the future, it will be able to work even with native video game applications! This is the dream of Reliverse's founderâ€“a single tool designed for everythingâ€“for anything!

### Commands

The Reliverse CLI provides a series of interactive prompts to guide you through the project setup:

1. **Create a New Project**: Build from scratch or use predefined templates.
2. **Install GitHub Templates**: Install any JavaScript/TypeScript project by providing a GitHub repository URL.
3. **Manage Configurations**: The CLI checks for existing configuration files and assists you in handling any conflicts.
4. **File Categories**: You can select from a variety of configuration categories for your project setup, such as ESLint, Biome, Putout, GitHub settings, and IDE preferences.
5. **Post-editing**: Reliverse never leaves you, if you wish it to. It holds your hand throughout your entire development journey. That's why you can run `reliverse` even in an already installed project. If your project's `package.json` contains an `appts` script, that's also a local piece of `reliverse` within your project.

### Example Workflow

Hereâ€™s an example session of using **Reliverse CLI**:

```bash
$ reliverse

? How do you want to proceed?
  1. I want to build my own Relivator from scratch
  2. I just want to install a template from GitHub

? Select the file categories you want to download:
  â—‰ eslint, biome, putout
  â—‰ GitHub
  â—‰ IDE
  â—‰ Reliverse configs

? Do you want to replace all existing files? (N opens Conflict Management menu) (y/N)
```

## Configuration Categories

When setting up a project, you can choose from the following file categories:

1. **eslint, biome, putout**
   - `.eslintrc.js`, `biome.json`, `.putout.json`
2. **GitHub**
   - `.github`, `README.md`
3. **IDE**
   - `.vscode`
4. **Reliverse configs**
   - `reliverse.config.ts`, `reliverse.info.ts`

## Conflict Management

**Reliverse CLI** helps you handle configuration conflicts for existing files such as `.eslintrc.cjs` or `prettier.config.js`. It prompts you with options to:

- **Remove**: Delete the existing file.
- **Rename**: Rename the file (e.g., add `.txt` to disable it).
- **Do nothing**: Keep the existing file.

### Conflict Example

```bash
? .eslintrc.cjs file exists. Do you want to remove or rename it?
  1. Remove
  2. Rename to .eslintrc.cjs.txt
  3. Do nothing
```

### Prettier Conflict Example

```bash
? prettier.config.js found. Biome will be installed, so Prettier is not necessary.
  1. Remove
  2. Rename to prettier.config.js.txt
  3. Do nothing
```

## Installing Other Templates

You can install any JavaScript/TypeScript project (it is not limited to e.g. Next.js templates, it can be anything, even js libs) from a GitHub repository by providing the repository URL during the interactive setup:

```bash
$ reliverse

? How do you want to proceed?
  1. I want to build my own Relivator from scratch
  2. I just want to install a template from GitHub
  3. I want to clone a library/tool from the GitHub

? Enter the GitHub repository link: (e.g., `https://github.com/user/repo`)
```

Reliverse will then clone the repository and set up the project.

## Development

Reliverse uses a different, non-standard approach compared to other bootstrappers. The author of this project has seen many CLIs that handle project bootstrapping. Many of them are truly cool. But their repositories contain a ton files that are later bundled into a single index.js, which is like the installer wizard. As a result, their repositories are often cluttered with a large number of files. Most of their repositories are so-called monorepos, which also adds to the complexity. In contrast, the reliverse/cli repository downloads specific files from already existing repositories and only copies from its own or generates files when it is really necessary.
