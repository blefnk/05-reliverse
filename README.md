## Coming Soon âœ¨

_Build a Site, Build an App, Build a Game, Build Everything._

This is the one app to build them all. It's comprehensive and powerful both code and no-code website builder. Work as you want. Sites/apps/games created with this builder will be super fast and beautiful by default.

Also, you can use it as Turborepo starter. But it's not currently production-ready. So you can check the [Relivator: A Next.js Starter](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator) for now.

This is the Reliverse Turborepo Edition. It's the Incremental Turborepo Superapp Starter ðŸ’» Next.js 13, Tauri Apps UI, Solito Expo ðŸ’ª i18n, Stripe, Shadcn, Tailwind, Drizzle Zod Trpc, TypeScript, Resend, Auth, Lucide CSS Radix UI, Responsive React Server, TS ORM, Intl App Router Docs, User Actions Kit, SaaS Commerce Shop, Subscriptions Payments, T3 Turbo Full Stack ðŸ¤© (more stars â†’ more features)

When you give us the star [on this repo](https://github.com/blefnk/reliverse), you take part in the lottery where a randomly selected person will receive a secret Reliverse feature of their choice as a gift!

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```sh
cd reliverse
pnpm dlx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```sh
pnpm dlx turbo link
```
