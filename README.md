```sh
cd reliverse
pnpm run build
```

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```sh
cd reliverse
pnpm run dev
```

## Monorepo Structure

This project includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `reliverse`: a [Reliverse](https://turbo.build) CLI
- `nextjs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app with App Router
- [coming soon] `expo`: a [Solito](https://solito.dev) app Expo Router
- [coming soon] `tauri`: a [Tauri](https://tauri.app) app with Tauri UI
- `@repo/eslintconfig`: `eslint` tool configurations (includes `eslint-config-next`)
- `@repo/tailwind-config` / `@repo/tsconfig` / `@repo/jsconfig`: tools used throughout the monorepo
- `@repo/primitives`: a stub React component library shared by the entire application
- `@repo/tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
- ...and much more!

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org).

### Utilities

This project has some additional tools already set up for you:

- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) for code linting
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) for code formatting and linting
- ...and much more!

## Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching, you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account, you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```sh
cd reliverse
bunx turbo login
bunx turbo link
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview) and link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why does the VSCode terminal exhibit unexpected behavior when interacting with CLI like Turbo and Reliverse?**

```sh
[Use arrows to move, type to filter] ‚Ä∫ [B[A[B
```

This is a known issue. Please use an external terminal instead. For Windows users, [PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4) is recommended.

**How can I fix the error: ENOWORKSPACES command does not support workspaces?**

To resolve this error, run the following command:

```sh
bunx next telemetry disable
```

### Adding New Options to Reliverse CLI

If you want to contribute a new option to Reliverse CLI, follow these steps:

1. Add the option to the `CliFlags` and `CliResults` interfaces in `src/cli/index.ts`.
2. Update the `defaultOptions.flags` and `defaultOptions` const in `src/cli/index.ts` with the new option.
3. Add prompts for the new option in the `runCli` function (find `return p.confirm`) to ask the user if they want to include the option.
4. Add the option to the `const availablePackages` and `const buildPkgInstallerMap` in `src/installers/index.ts`.
5. Create a new installer file for the option in `src/installers/optionNameInstaller.ts`.
6. Place the necessary files to be copied in `template/extras/*`.
7. List the library in `const dependencyVersionMap` in `src/installers/dependencyVersionMap.ts`.
8. Find `if (project.` and add your option correspondingly.
9. In the return statement, add the option in the format: `optionName: project.optionName as "none" | "option1" | "option2"`.
10. If needed, find the relevant section (e.g., "Install the selected i18n package") and add your option accordingly.
11. Update `const selectLayoutFile` and `const selectPageFile` in `src/installers/index.ts` if required.
12. Add final log notes in `logNextSteps.ts` file for your option.
13. Update the required environment variables in `envVars.ts` file if necessary.
14. Update the scripts in `base/package.json` if needed.

## How to Use This Library

To use `@reliverse/cli`, ensure that your project is set up as an ES module by including `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` file. Since this package is structured as an ES module, you'll need to use `import` statements instead of `require`.

The library primarily relies on the async versions of `fs` functions, so you need to add the `await` keyword before the utils from our library.

Here's an example of how to import and use a function from this package:

```ts
import { fileExists } from "@reliverse/cli";

const someFile = "path/to/file.ts";

export async function checkFile() {
  await fileExists(someFile);
}
```

Please refer to the source files located in the [`src` folder](https://github.com/reliverse/cli/blob/main/src) to learn about the currently implemented functions.

This package adopts the ES module format, with files compiled to `dist/.js` (formerly known as `dist/.mjs`). This approach aligns with the Node.js team's recent recommendations, encouraging the JavaScript/TypeScript community to transition to the ES module standard. If your project still requires CommonJS (CJS) support, you may fork this repository and modify the build process to generate `dist/.cjs` files. For guidance or community support, join the [Reliverse Discord community](https://discord.gg/C4Z46fHKQ8).
