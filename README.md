## Monorepo Structure

This project includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `nextjs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app with App Router
- `expo`: a [Solito](https://solito.dev) app Expo Router (coming soon)
- `tauri`: a [Tauri](https://tauri.app) app with Tauri UI (coming soon)
- `@tools/eslintconfig`: `eslint` tool configurations (includes `eslint-config-next`)
- `@tools/tailwind-config` / `@tools/tsconfig` / `@repo/jsconfig`: tools used throughout the monorepo
- `@packages/ui`: a stub React component library shared by the entire application
- `@tools/tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
- ...and much more!

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This project has some additional tools already set up for you:

- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) for code formatting and linting

## Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching, you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account, you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```sh
cd reliverse
bunx turbo login
bunx turbo link
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview) and link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache.
